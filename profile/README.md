#  Robotics and Ultrasound Team @ CAMP, TUM
Welcome to  the Robotics and Ultrasound team (RobUSt) of the Chair for [Computer-Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMP)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp) of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/cv-nassir-navab/nassir-navab/) at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/).
Our team aims to shape autonomous and intelligent solutions for the future healthcare industry by focusing on the joint field of robotics and ultrasound image analysis. 

To accomplish such interdisciplinary tasks, we endeavor to develop advanced machine learning techniques to improve the understanding of images and scenes (ultrasound images, MRI, CT, RGB-D images, etc), shared control to improve the safety and better human-robotic interaction performance, robotic learning to learn and encode the operational skills from experienced clinicians. Currently, the clinical applications include scanning of limb arteries, thyroid, spine/bone, and abdominal. The RobUSt group is based in Klinikum Rechts der Isar, which allows close cooperation with clinicians to impact future clinical practices.
